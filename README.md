I've decided to study frontend web development again, starting with ReactJS.
In order to keep my discipline and pratice I started a journal on my own.
50 days of React. Where I'll be learning ReactJS in a deeper way while building projects.


So, this is my first day and also my first project. (1/50)

## Let's Go!!
